Categorization orchestration.

The order is the whole point:

    1. Exact rules      -- unambiguous markers: exact dues amount, a memo, the
                           sign of a transfer. Certainties.
    2. The card roster  -- a purchase on a card treasury has confirmed for the
                           current officer cohort defaults to that card's
                           committee, unless the other evidence confidently
                           names a different one (treasury ruling, 2026-10-01;
                           from 2026-09-23 until then the card was absolute).
    3. Scoring          -- keyword, weekday and amount evidence, gated on
                           confidence; the uncertain rest goes to a human
    4. The model        -- only what is genuinely left over

The original ran the model *first*, over every transaction, and then overrode
most of its answers with Python rules -- paying for answers it discarded. This
inverts that.

MERCHANT MEMORY IS GONE (2026-09-23). A tier between 2 and 3 used to book a
merchant the way a human had filed it before. Treasury ruled it out: the same
merchant serves too many committees -- Consulting food and Meeting Food
especially come from the same restaurants -- for its history to predict the
next purchase, and a remembered merchant was able to override the card, which
is the one piece of evidence that actually says whose spending it was. What a
treasurer decides in the Review Queue is still logged as a label (for the
spot-check and evaluation tools); it just no longer turns into a rule.
